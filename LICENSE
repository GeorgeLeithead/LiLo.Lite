In no event will the authors or copyright holders be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the software, even if the authors or copyright holders have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

If you initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Program or a contribution incorporated within the Program constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for that Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
